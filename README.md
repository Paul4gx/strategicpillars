You are generating a complete real estate company website and admin dashboard using Laravel (already installed), and an HTML template located in the `/template` directory.

The project is for a well-established real estate company in Lagos named **Strategic Pillars**. The company specializes in:
- Real estate sales and development (they build and sell their own properties)
- Estate development
- Luxury interior decoration and design
- Shortlet apartment rentals and bookings

## üõ†Ô∏è General Project Setup:
- Use Laravel as the backend framework
- HTML template already available in `/template` folder
- No frontend scaffolding needed from Laravel (use the provided HTML)
- Routes should be neatly separated between `web.php` (for public site) and `admin.php` (for dashboard)
- Use Blade templating to connect Laravel with HTML
- All content on the frontend pages (like properties, estates, shortlets) should be manageable from the admin dashboard

## üß≠ Public Website Pages:
Create Blade views for each of the following and bind them to a controller:
- `/` (Homepage): Highlights featured properties, featured shortlets, recent interiors, about section, contact info
- `/about-us`: Detailed description of the company, mission, vision, leadership, and operations
- `/contact`: Company address, map, contact form (send email), phone, and social media links
- `/agents`: Profile cards for listed agents from database
- `/interiors`: Page showing various luxury interior decoration projects (images, category, and description)
- `/shortlets`: Paginated list of available shortlet apartments with filters
- `/properties`: List of all available properties, off-plan properties, and filters by estate/category
- `/estates/{slug}`: Show properties under a specific estate
- `/property/{slug}` and `/shortlet/{slug}`: Single property/shortlet detail pages
- Add dynamic SEO meta title/description from controller or Blade data

## üßë‚Äçüíº Admin Dashboard (no user dashboard needed):
Route this under `/admin`, protected by authentication middleware.

### Core Modules:
1. **Authentication**
   - Admin login/logout only
   - Use Laravel Breeze or Laravel UI for quick setup

2. **Property Management**

   - Fields: title, slug, price, status (available, sold, off-plan), description, images (multiple), location, type (residential, commercial, etc.), attach to estate (optional)
   - Image upload with preview
   - Display on `/properties` and single pages

3. **Estate Management**
   - Create/edit/delete estates
   - Each estate has name, slug, description, location, cover image
   - Properties can be assigned to an estate
   - Display estates on frontend with `/estates/{slug}` route

4. **Shortlet Management**
   - Add/edit/delete shortlets
   - Fields: name, slug, location, nightly price, availability status, images, features
   - Booking calendar and status display (availability management)

5. **Booking Management**
   - View list of shortlet bookings
   - Manual status update (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)

6. **Interior Projects**
   - Add/edit/delete interior design projects
   - Each with title, category, description, images
   - Displayed on `/interiors`

7. **Team Management**
   - Add/edit/delete agent or staff profile
   - Each profile includes: name, photo, position, bio, contact, social links
   - Display on `/agents`

8. **Contact Messages**
   - Save messages submitted from contact form
   - Admin can view and mark as handled

9. **General Site Settings**
   - Company name, logo, email, address, phone, social links
   - Footer text, SEO defaults, etc.

## ‚ú® Advanced Functionality:
- Use Laravel Media Library or simple file system for image uploads
- Slugs should be automatically generated from titles
- Use policies/middleware to protect routes
- Optional: queue email for contact form and shortlet booking notifications

## üìÅ Folder References:
- Use views from `/template` folder as layout/base HTML
- Extract reusable layouts into Blade templates (`layouts.master`, `layouts.admin`, etc.)
- All image uploads stored in `public/uploads/`

Generate all necessary models, migrations, controllers, views, routes, and seeders where needed.
